    <h2 id="chasing_cars">Chasing Cars</h2>
      <p>If you ever see a dog chasing a car, you might think it's completely normal. Dogs do that. I'm not sure if they are chasing the car in a fun, playful way, or if they are trying to attack the car, because the car is usually faster than the dog. But if you ever see a person chasing a dog that is chasing a car, how can you REALLY be sure the human is chasing the dog? We assume they are, but would we know the difference if the human and the dog were both chasing the car? The dog is probably faster than the human, so it may just look like the human is chasing the dog because they can't keep up (having only 2 legs). Next time you see a human chasing a dog chasing a car, maybe you should chase them down to ask them whether they're chasing the dog or the car. Be aware, however, that to an observer, you may just be chasing the car along with the dog and the other human.</p>

    <h2 id="cheese">Cheese is a Legitimate Food Group</h2>
      <p>When I was a child, we were taught basic nutrition. I don't remember everything we were taught, but the one thing that stands out to me is that cheese is a good source of protein and calcium. I took that to heart. In my 37 years of life, I have never had a broken bone. I attribute that to the fact that I eat cheese daily and also don't play sports at all. But mostly, it's the cheese. I feel like I could probably be a vegan if it weren't for cheese. If I ever have a farm, I think I'll keep a few happy cows and goats and learn to make my own cheese. If I can't be vegan, I can at least make sure my cheese comes from happy holsteins.</p>
