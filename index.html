    <h2 id="chasing_cars">Chasing Cars</h2>
      <p>If you ever see a dog chasing a car, you might think it's completely normal. Dogs do that. I'm not sure if they are chasing the car in a fun, playful way, or if they are trying to attack the car, because the car is usually faster than the dog. But if you ever see a person chasing a dog that is chasing a car, how can you REALLY be sure the human is chasing the dog? We assume they are, but would we know the difference if the human and the dog were both chasing the car? The dog is probably faster than the human, so it may just look like the human is chasing the dog because they can't keep up (having only 2 legs). Next time you see a human chasing a dog chasing a car, maybe you should chase them down to ask them whether they're chasing the dog or the car. Be aware, however, that to an observer, you may just be chasing the car along with the dog and the other human.</p>
    <h2 id="lester">Nobody Bester Than Lester</h2>
      <p>I know that plenty of people feel like their dog is the best. And maybe for them, their dog is the best. I know mine sure is. I'm not debating that anyone's dog is NOT the best, so don't get that idea. All I'm saying is that of all the best dogs, Lester is just a little bit bester. In fact, there is no dog bester than Lester. He has his little out-turned seal-fin front paws, floppy long ears, and a barrel-shaped torso. He refuses to let anyone around him stay in a sad mood. He'll put his head in your lap, agressively cuddle, and try to get you to play. I know a lot of dogs do these things, but Lester does them bester. He has a very refined palette, with a strong affininty for smoked gouda and havarti cheeses. He eats fruits and vegetables and brown rice without any complaints, and he sometimes wants to share. I politely decline, but the willingness means a lot.  </p>
    <h2 id="cheese">Cheese is a Legitimate Food Group</h2>
      <p>When I was a child, we were taught basic nutrition. I don't remember everything we were taught, but the one thing that stands out to me is that cheese is a good source of protein and calcium. I took that to heart. In my 37 years of life, I have never had a broken bone. I attribute that to the fact that I eat cheese daily and also don't play sports at all. But mostly, it's the cheese. I feel like I could probably be a vegan if it weren't for cheese. If I ever have a farm, I think I'll keep a few happy cows and goats and learn to make my own cheese. If I can't be vegan, I can at least make sure my cheese comes from happy holsteins.</p>
